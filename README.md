# ProofDrop

**ProofDrop** is a decentralized platform for creating permanent, public records backed by NFTs.  
Whether you want to preserve a truth, share a moment, or keep data safe from censorship, ProofDrop lets you do it with confidence.

## What is ProofDrop?

At its core, ProofDrop lets you:

- Upload files or documents anonymously and permanently (via Arweave).
- Mint an NFT that proves your submission exists forever on-chain.
- Browse all submissions transparently.

This isn’t just another app. It’s a monument for truth and memory that can’t be erased.

## How It Works

1. Upload a file from your device.
2. The file gets stored permanently on Arweave via Bundlr.
3. A JSON metadata file is created with your submission details.
4. You mint an NFT on Polygon Mumbai testnet that links to your metadata.
5. Your submission is publicly viewable, immutable, and censorship-resistant.
